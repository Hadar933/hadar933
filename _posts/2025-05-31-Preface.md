This entire preface was written by AI because I’m too lazy to write opening notes.

Anyway, welcome.

This blog is my place to capture thoughts, experiments, half-baked ideas, and strong opinions (loosely held) about machine learning, AI research, and building real-world systems.

You'll find a mix of:
- explanations about models and algorithms
- Notes from papers I’m reading or rewriting in my head
- Lessons from leading ML teams and building products
- Random experiments that may or may not go anywhere

It’s informal, a bit raw by design, and written more for clarity than polish. Let’s see where it goes.

P.S. — Any blog post published before this preface originally appeared on platforms like Ghost, Medium, or Substack. While I made attempts to continue with those platforms, I’ve ultimately decided not to move forward with them.

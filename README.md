## Fun Facts  
- [Substack]([https://hadar933.github.io/hadar933/](https://substack.com/@hadars) – A place for thoughts, experiments, half-baked ideas, and strong opinions (loosely held) about machine learning, AI research, and building real-world systems.
- I love building apps, and [Locator](https://locator.ltd) is a notable one. It's a tool for travelers that maps locations from blogs and social media automatically. It is entirely bootstrapped and brings in some $ MRR.

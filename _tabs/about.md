I'm a machine learning researcher, and currently Director of Deep Learning at [Fetcherr](https://fetcherr.io). I hold a B.Sc. in Physics and Computer Science, and a Master's in Computer Science, specializing in time series modeling. I love building applied deep learning systems that make a real impact.

I'm also a husband, a dad, and a recovering weightlifter.

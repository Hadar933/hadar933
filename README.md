## Fun Facts  
- I love building apps, and [Locator](https://locator.ltd) is a notable one. It's a tool for travelers that maps locations from blogs and social media automatically. It is entirely bootstrapped and brings in some $ MRR.
- [Blog](https://hadar933.github.io/hadar933/) – A place where I capture thoughts, experiments, half-baked ideas, and strong opinions (loosely held) about machine learning, AI research, and building real-world systems.
